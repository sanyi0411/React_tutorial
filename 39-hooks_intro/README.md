# React Hooks

React is heading in a direction that largely makes class components unnecessary. Hooks rendered them unnecessary.

React Hooks are a way the "hook into" the lifecycle of component using just functional components.

Now you don't class components for state or almost all lifecycle methods. This allows you to just stick to funstional components across your entire app.

Hooks can dramatically improve the readablity and organization of your components.

Most important: useState() and useEffect()

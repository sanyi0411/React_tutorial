# How to setup your enviroment to start learn React (the quick way)

1. Download Visual Studio Code
    - This is the IDE I recommend but you can use your favourite
    - You can download VSCode from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Download Node.js
    - Download from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    - Or check if you have it already installed by typing in the command line: `node -v`
3. Run `npx create-react-app my-app`
    - npx is a tool for executing Node packages. It comes bundled with npm version 5.2 and higher
    - This command will create a new folder for your app, named `my-app`
4. Move into the project folder and run `npm start`
5. Open `http://localhost:3000/` to see your app.
